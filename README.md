# Redisplay

Redisplay is a project that uses OLED displays to monitor
Redis activity. This project is the first prototype
towards a general platform for tiny physical and remote
monitors called **Stat Cubes**. It is still under development
and it will be redesigned in future to support different
services with a new hardware wireless platform.
